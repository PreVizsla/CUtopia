# Server - Video Chat (WIP):video_camera: 

Updated as of April 14 2021 

This folder take care for the video chat feature. It contains both the client side and server side code, where the client side code can be seen in public folder and server side code can be seen in src folder.

The backbone of this feature is using typescript, since it has been supported by [socket.io API and documentation](https://socket.io/docs/v4/server-installation/)  and it prevents the runtime error that might be caused by Javascript.
