# About CUtopia :rocket:

Updated as of April 30 2021

In this fast changing world, mentorship has been proven to be of vital
importance at every stage of our unpredictable lives. At present, there is no
comprehensive mentorship platform that caters specifically to the needs of
The Chinese University of Hong Kong students. Our software, CUtopia, will
provide a platform for potential mentors and mentees to connect with one
another, have conversations using our in-built smart chat assistant, host
video calls and be able to share ideas and opportunities with one another.

CUtopia is a web application that will address the issue of mentorship by
providing a web based application, tailor-made for CUHK students and alumni
possessing a valid CUHK email address. :family_man_woman_girl_boy:

## What's Next :world_map:

This is because we aim to deliver not just a project, but an actual product that can actually be of real-use to The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Other than that, we have learned alot in the span of these few months and would like to thank Prof. Michael and all the wonderful TAs for their guidance. It has been a fun ride! :wink:
