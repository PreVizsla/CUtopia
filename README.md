# About CUtopia :rocket:

Updated as of March 19 2021 - Initial Code Phase

In this fast changing world, mentorship has been proven to be of vital
importance at every stage of our unpredictable lives. At present, there is no
comprehensive mentorship platform that caters specifically to the needs of
The Chinese University of Hong Kong students. Our software, CUtopia, will
provide a platform for potential mentors and mentees to connect with one
another, have conversations using our in-built smart chat assistant, host
video calls and be able to share ideas and opportunities with one another.

CUtopia is a web application that will address the issue of mentorship by
providing a web based application, tailor-made for CUHK students and alumni
possessing a valid CUHK email address. :family_man_woman_girl_boy:

### Current Progress as of March 19 2021 (Initial Code Phase) :technologist:

As of now, we have begun work on both the front-end and the back-end of our application. :smile:

For the front-end, we have finished the landing page, sign-up/log-in page and also clicking on the login button will direct you to a sneak peek of what the inside of CUtopia will look like. For the back-end, we have started work on the components for user authentication. Images of our progress are shown below:

#### Landing Page:

## What's Next :world_map:	
In this coming month, we will focus on completing the entirety of the project.
